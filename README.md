# Solstice's Figuras

| Library | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [addScriptPolyfill](./addScriptPolyfill//README.md) | Backports 0.1.6's `addScript` to lower versions. |
| [HORSE](./HORSE/README.md) | Host Only Resource / Script Executor |
| [SolsticeCallbacks](./SolsticeCallbacks/README.md) | Simple library I made because I got lazy with `Future`s, now available for all your being-lazy needs. |

## License?
Do whatever the hell you want with these, I won't stop you. There isn't a license listed here because, to be frank, I am pretty much clueless in the world of licenses. If you know a good license that sums up to "Do what you want, just dont claim you made it" or whatever, feel free to spam me in dms or with a ping about it.
